#### About me:

_I'm 32 years old. I have been working as engineer in nuclear industry
for the last 10 years. I have achieved significant results in my work
but now I do not see any further prospects for my career in this area.
So i decided to switch to IT and start to learning JavaScript to become a front-end developer. Programming is based on logic, critical thinking and the creation of algorithms. All this impresses me and I feel that I can realize myself in IT. The opportunity to work remotely also appeals to me. I want to get practice, knowledge and skills, which will be my advantages for employment in IT._
